# coverageX_assessment
This repository contains my solution to the CoverageX assessment for the Full Stack Software Engineer position.  
The assignment was to build a simple SPA task manager application.

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Database** → MySQL  
2. **Backend** → Node.js with Express (TypeScript)  
3. **Frontend** → React + Vite + Tailwind (TypeScript)
